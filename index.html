          This project is my scratch game I made for my summer homework for
          computer science. It's nothing too special but it was my first major
          project in ap computer science.

          This project is very special as it's the 1st very significant one and
          it took a long time to make. This drawing app version is updated with
          a much cleaner looks and being far more refined than the previous
          version and even having a copy and pasting mechanic implemented into
          it.

          This project is something I'm particularly proud of because me and my
          friends scored a 80/70. I thought it said 70/80 while checking at like
          3 am but when I actually carefully looked it said 80/70 which was
          crazy because we didn’t even try that hard. The teacher even called it
          one of the all time goated projects he’s ever seen.
