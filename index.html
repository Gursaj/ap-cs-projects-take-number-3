          This project is my scratch game I made for my summer homework for
          computer science. It's nothing too special but it was my first major
          in computer science.

          This project is very special as it's the 1st very significant one and
          it took a long time to make. Some things are still not finished but
          overall most of it is complete and functions properly.

          This project is something I'm particularly proud of because me and my
          friends scored a 80/70. I thought it said 70/80 while checking at like
          3 am but when I actually carefully looked it said 80/70 which was
          crazy because we didn’t even try that hard. The teacher even called it
          one of the all time goated projects he’s ever seen.
